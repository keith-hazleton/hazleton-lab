            <h2>Research Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The Hazleton Lab investigates the complex relationships between nutrition, infection, and hepatic disease. Based at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, our work focuses on understanding how dietary factors influence disease pathogenesis and outcomes in pediatric gastroenterology.
            </p>
            <p>
                We collaborate closely with the <a href="https://lozuponelab.com" target="_blank">Lozupone Lab</a> at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus to leverage cutting-edge microbiome research methods.

                <li>
                    <strong>Nutrition-driven illness</strong><br>
                    Examining how nutritional status and interventions impact disease outcomes in pediatric gastroenterology

            <h2>Collaboration</h2>
            <p>
                While the "lab" designation is somewhat aspirational at this stage—currently a solo research effort—we actively collaborate with established research groups including the Lozupone Lab's microbiome research program. We welcome inquiries about potential collaborations and research opportunities.
